 * This class generates random integers within a given range by creating a

 * randomly.  First, a stack of size 101 is created and filled with random
 * doubles.  Everytime an integer is drawn, an element is selected from the
 * stack randomly.  The value at the selected element is used to generate
 * a random integer then that element in the stack is filled with a
 * newly generated double.
