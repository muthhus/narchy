/**
 * from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/15654081
 * Class extends ThreadLocal to enable user to iterate over all objects
 * held by the ThreadLocal instance.  Note that this is inherently not
 * thread-safe, and violates both the contract of ThreadLocal and much
 * of the benefit of using a ThreadLocal object.  This class incurs all
 * the overhead of a ConcurrentHashMap, perhaps you would prefer to
 * simply use a ConcurrentHashMap directly instead?
 * 
 * If you do really want to use this class, be wary of its iterator.
 * While it is as threadsafe as ConcurrentHashMap's iterator, it cannot
 * guarantee that all existing objects in the ThreadLocal are available
 * to the iterator, and it cannot prevent you from doing dangerous
 * things with the returned values.  If the returned values are not
 * properly thread-safe, you will introduce issues.
